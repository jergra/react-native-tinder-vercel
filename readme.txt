C:\webdev\react-native-tinder-vercel>

This is from a tutorial by Esteban Codes:
    Build a Tinder clone with React Native and Expo
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfaV2AfQysE&ab_channel=EstebanCodes

C:\webdev\react-native-tinder is deployed at:
    https://expo.dev/@jergra43/react-native-tinder

we want a deployment that opens, on a phone (that has Expo on it), 
with one click, the following link:
    exp://exp.host/@jergra43/react-native-tinder

this deployment on vercel makes this possible.

to start locally:
    double cick on index.html in Windows Explorer
    a blank white page will open
